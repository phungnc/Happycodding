 A JAVASCRIPT LIBRARY FOR BUILDING USER INTERFACES

 - JUST THE UI
 - VIRTUAL DOM
 - DATA FLOW

1. JUST THE UI

  React.js is the Library that create Component.

2. VIRTUAL DOM

  React uses a virtual DOM diff implementation for ultra-high performance.
  React use DOM Tree structure as VIRTUAL DOM inside Javascript lib.
  When app rerendering, it compare the diff before and after of DOM Tree Structure, then minimize the changing of actual DOM so speed up performance.

3. DATA FLOW

  React implements one-way reactive data flow which reduces boilerplate and is easier to reason about than traditional data binding.
